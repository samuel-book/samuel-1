<h3>Stroke<a class="headerlink" href="#stroke" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Stroke is a medical condition where blood flow to an area of the brain has been interrupted, causing cell death. Stroke may be broadly categorised into two types: ischaemic, due to an arterial blockage, and haemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Stroke is a major cause of adult long-term disability and is a major burden on healthcare services. It was estimated that in 2010, there were 5.9 million deaths and 33 million stroke survivors worldwide. Eighty five thousand people are hospitalized with stroke each year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Over the last 25 years stroke was the leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life years, which combine mortality and disability burdens.</p>

<div class="section" id="intravenous-thrombolysis-ivt">
<h3>Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT)<a class="headerlink" href="#intravenous-thrombolysis-ivt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is a form of ‘clot-busting’ therapy developed to treat ischaemic stroke by removing or reducing the blood clot impairing blood flow in the brain.
For ischaemic strokes, IVT is an effective treatment for the management of acute stroke if given soon (within 4 hours) after stroke onset, and is recommended for use in many parts of the world including Europe.</p>
<p>Based on expert clinical opinion, the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme Report, the NHS long term plan, and the specification of the Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks all provide a target of 20% of stroke patients receiving thrombolysis. Currently 11%-12% of patients in England and Wales receive thrombolysis, with significant inter-hospital variability (per-hospital thrombolysis use ranges from 2% to 25%).</p>
<p>Use of thrombolysis is therefore lower than target, and highly variable between hospitals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clinical-audit">
<h3>Clinical audit<a class="headerlink" href="#clinical-audit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>NHS England describes clinical audit in the following way:</p>
<p>“Clinical audit is a way to find out if healthcare is being provided in line with standards and lets care providers and patients know where their service is doing well, and where there could be improvements. The aim is to allow quality improvement to take place where it will be most helpful and will improve outcomes for patients…”</p>
<p>The national audit covering stroke is the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP). SSNAP collects longitudinal data on the processes and outcomes of stroke care up to 6 months post-stroke for more than 90% of stroke admissions to acute hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Every year data from approximately 85 000 patients are collected. SSNAP publishes quarterly and yearly analysis of results.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objectives">
<h2>Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We seek to enhance the national stroke audit by providing further analysis of the thrombolysis pathway at each hospital, identifying areas which would most improve the clinical benefit of thrombolysis, allowing quality improvement to focus down on the most influential aspect.</p>

<h3>Modelling of the stroke thrombolysis pathway<a class="headerlink" href="#modelling-of-the-stroke-thrombolysis-pathway" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We model three aspects of the thrombolysis pathway:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>Pathway speed</em>: what would be the effect of changing time from arrival to scan, or time from scan to treatment?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Determination of stroke onset time</em>: what would be the effect of changing the proportion of patients with determined stroke onset time?</p></li>

<p>Data was retrieved for 246,676 emergency stroke admissions to acute stroke teams in England and Wales between 2016 and 2018 (three full years). Data used is for units which have at least 300 emergency stroke admissions with at least 10 patients receiving thrombolysis in the three years.</p>

<h3>Qualitative research<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the project we undertook interviews with groups and single clinicians. These were both face-to-face and via video. Due to Covid-19, interviews moved to entirely being remote during the project.</p>
<p>During the interviews, we collected data about physicians’ backgrounds, their attitudes to thrombolysis and their understanding of variance, their perspectives on machine learning, and potential loci for the implementation of machine learning feedback (within and beyond SSNAP), established the physicians’ views on possible unintended consequences, which may result from changing the acute stroke pathway, and potential means of mitigation.</p>

<div class="section" id="machine-learning-performance">
<h4>Machine learning performance<a class="headerlink" href="#machine-learning-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Machine learning accuracy was assessed using stratified k-fold cross-validation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Machine learning models ranged from 78% to 86% accuracy depending on model type. The model with the highest accuracy was a neural network using three <em>embedding layers</em> for hospital ID, clinical features of the patients, and pathway timings.</p></li>
<li><p>There is high agreement between model types. Logistic regression (single fit), random forests (single fit), and neural networks (single fit, 1D embedding) agree classification on 87% of patients. Neural networks and random forests agree on 93% of patients.</p></li>
<li><p>There is generally higher agreement between model types (87% to 93% for any pairwise comparison), than between models and reality (83% to 86% accuracy for the same model types).</p></li>
<li><p>Combining outputs of the three model types into one combined model (an ensemble model) did not improve accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Accuracy of models increased with training set size up to about 30k training set examples.</p></li>
<li><p>All random forest and neural network models were well calibrated, meaning that 9 out of 10 people with a predicted 90% probability of receiving thrombolysis would receive thrombolysis.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparing-decisions-between-hospitals">
<h4>Comparing decisions between hospitals<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-decisions-between-hospitals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For most modelling (e.g. inclusion in stroke pathway model) we have chosen to use hospital-level random forests models. Though accuracy is a little lower than the best models, these models are easier for people to understand and have strong hospital independence. When comparing predicted decisions between hospitals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is easier to find majority agreement on who not to thrombolyse than who to thrombolyse. 77.5% of all patients have a treatment decision that is agreed by 80% hospitals. Of those who were not given thrombolysis, 84.6% had agreement by 80% hospitals. Of those who were given thrombolysis, 60.4% had agreement by 80% hospitals.</p></li>
<li><p>A comparison of a hospital’s likelihood to give thrombolysis may be made by passing the a standard 10k patient cohort set through all hospitals. This evaluates likelihood to give thrombolysis independently from hospitals own local patient populations.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>benchmark</em> set of hospitals was created by passing the same 10k patient cohort set through all hospitals, and selecting the 30 hospitals with the highest thrombolysis use. If all thrombolysis decisions were made by a majority vote of these hospitals then thrombolysis use (in those arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset) would be expected to increase from 29.5% to 36.9%.</p></li>
<li><p>Models may be used to identify two types of patients (and patient vignettes may be constructed to illustrate particular types of patients):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Patients where the model has high confidence in prediction, but were not treated as expected (e.g. a patient who appears to have high suitability for thrombolysis, but did not receive it).</p></li>
<li><p>Patients which were treated according to the prediction of the hospital model, but where the majority of the benchmark hospitals would have treated that patient differently.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hospitals may be grouped by comparison of what proportion of patients would be expected to have the same thrombolysis decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Using embedding neural networks, similar patients (e.g. haemorrhagic stroke patients, or patients with severe stroke) are located close together in embedding space. Patient embedding may also be use to rank patients in order of suitability for thrombolysis (by consensus across all hospitals). Similarly hospital embedding may be used to rank hospitals by likelihood to use thrombolysis, independent of patient and pathway characteristics.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pathway-simulation">
<h3>Pathway simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#pathway-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The model is used to examine the effect, at each hospital and nationally, of making three key changes (alone or in combination) to the stroke pathway:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Speed: Sets 95% of patients having a scan within 4 hours of arrival, and all patients have 15 minutes arrival to scan and 15 minutes scan to needle.</p></li>
<li><p>Onset-known: Sets the proportion of patients with a known onset time of stroke to the national upper quartile if currently less than the national upper quartile (leave any greater than the upper national quartile at their current level).</p></li>
<li><p>Benchmark: The benchmark thrombolysis rate takes the likelihood to give thrombolysis for patients scanned within 4 hours of onset from the majority vote of the 30 hospitals with the highest predicted thrombolysis use in a standard 10k cohort set of patients. These are from Random Forests models.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The model predicts current thrombolysis use with high accuracy (R-squared of 0.980, mean absolute difference in thrombolysis use of 0.5 percentage points).</p></li>
<li><p>Combining the three changes suggests that thrombolysis use could potentially be increased from 11.6% to 18.3% of all emergency admissions, and the clinical benefit increased from 9.4 to 17.6 additional good outcomes per 1,000 admissions. The average drivers in improvement in thrombolysis use are benchmark decisions &gt; determining stroke onset &gt; speed, while the average drivers in improvement in outcomes are speed &gt; benchmark decisions &gt; determining stroke onset.</p></li>
<li><p>The model identifies the changes that make most difference at each hospital.</p></li>
