# Qualitative research

## Objectives

The overall objective of the qualitative research was to understand influence of modelling, including the use of machine learning techniques, in the context of the national audit, in order to support efforts to maximise the appropriate use of thrombolysis and reduce unnecessary variation. 

Specifically the aims were to:

1. Explore current understanding and rationale for the use of thrombolysis for ischaemic stroke, in order to establish reasons for the variance in the use and speed of thrombolysis.

2. Understand physician perspectives on simulation and machine learning feedback, to influence how simulation can be incorporated into the Sentinel Stroke National Audi Programme (SSNAP) to have a positive impact on practice. 

3. Identify potential routes for the implementation of machine learning feedback, to inform and improve future stroke management.

4. Explore how physicians interpret the potential consequences of following changes in pathway suggested by simulation.

## Data collection

Ethical approval was provided by the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) 19/HRA/5796.

To pilot our interview approach, we undertook a face-to-face group interview with a small group of medical registrars on a regional rotation that included stroke, in their clinical setting. Having given written consent to interview, a senior modeller (MA) provided the registrars with a demonstration of the modelling process and outcomes, prior to the qualitative researchers piloting the topic guide. Feedback from the stroke physicians suggested that this approach was appropriate and produced data that was fit for purpose.
Our approach was subsequently modified for remote delivery, with all interviews conducted via MS Teams, Skype or Zoom, dependant on the media that was allowed in each NHS Trust. At the beginning of each interview participants watched a 10-minute video made by the senior modeller that contained examples of the process and outcomes of the machine modelling and pathway analysis, as a stimulus for discussion [1]. The topic guide was then used to elicit participants’ own experiences of thrombolysis and perspectives on machine learning, alongside observations of group interactions and clinical settings [2].

During the interviews, we collected data about physicians’ backgrounds, their attitudes to thrombolysis and their understanding of variance, their perspectives on machine learning, and potential loci for the implementation of machine learning feedback (within and beyond SSNAP), established the physicians’ views on possible unintended consequences, which may result from changing the acute stroke pathway, and potential means of mitigation. Our fieldnotes reflected the challenges of conducting interviews via video, with physicians often in clinical settings and sometimes wearing PPE, as well as capturing the dynamics between physicians, who were also remote working from each other [3, 4].

Towards the end of the project, and during the third lockdown for COVID-19, we undertook an online discussion of our results with a small group of physicians (N=3) who were identified via an annual meeting for trainees, organised by the British Association for Stroke Physicians (BASP). The modellers (MA, CJ) presented a further set of outputs from their analyses, and the discussion focused on how additional modelling outputs might be used to facilitate quality improvement and inform service delivery.

## Data analysis

Interview data was transcribed by an independent GDPR-compliant transcriber, and fieldnotes were written up by the two researchers. All data were anonymised and managed in Nvivo for Teams [5]. Both researchers read all the transcripts to develop preliminary ideas and understanding. We developed these ideas alongside further re-reading of the transcripts, using a Framework Analysis aligned with the four broad exploratory objectives of the study, but crucially with an openness to any new insights from the physicians [6], [7]. Analytical summaries across multiple cases were created independently by both researchers, and used to explore the data. We held repeat discussions to develop the analysis, looking for negative cases, and resolving differences of opinion about interpretation [8]. In this way, we were able to examine these physicians’ accounts of their use of thrombolysis and orientation to machine learning and simulation. As our analyses developed, we also discussed our findings with members of the wider research team.

## Results

### Interview participants

We recruited nineteen participants, who took part in three individual and five group interviews. Eleven of the participants were consultants (specialising in stroke, neurology or elderly care) with four stroke registrars and one specialist stroke nurse. Ten participants were male and nine were female.

### Current attitudes to thrombolysis use
Physicians working in hospitals with lower thrombolysis rates were more likely to suggest that a significant barrier to thrombolysis was the delayed presentation of patients, which could be magnified by suboptimal ambulance services:

```{admonition} Quote
*“A lot of patients present outside the window of thrombolysis at the hospital.”* (Site B)

*“I think we rarely hit the 11% percent national numbers, probably because patients come just outside the thrombolysis window.”* (Site A)
```

Those working in hospitals with lower thrombolysis rates were more likely to report that their patients were ‘different’ to those presenting at other centres – in terms of rurality, ethnicity, frailty, or socio-demographic factors: 

```{admonition} Quote
*“We’ve a slightly older population… we’ve slightly more bleeds than infarcts…we’re a slightly larger geographical area, so sometimes people are a bit delayed getting to hospital and we operate across two sites as well.”* (Site C)
```
The above physician also highlighted that because of these complexities, decision making about thrombolysis was the most difficult part of their job. 
While population differences were also acknowledged by physicians at higher thrombolysing centres, they were more likely to articulate the centrality of patient heterogeneity in their decision making: 

```{admonition} Quote
Consultant 1: *“I wouldn’t be giving thrombolysis for various reasons… They’re often late, or got a very mild deficit, or they’ve got something that makes you feel extra wary about treating them… we’ve got a population that’s increasingly frail, they’ve got multiple comorbidities… [but] every patient is unique.”*

Consultant 2: *“We all have different approaches, I say to myself the first question is, if I don’t thrombolyse this patient, what is the worst neurological outcome they could have? What is the disability going to be? And then the next question is how far are we down the time pathway, what’s the risk of bleeding here? And then, what are the little things that feed into pros and cons, how does that alter the equation from a standard patient? is it that the benefits are going to outweigh the risks, how finely balanced is that decision?”*

Consultant 3: *“The days of people being textbook strokes are long gone… we don’t see them… we don’t have a blanket policy. We eyeball them. And if they look dodgy we park them and work out what’s going on, if they don’t look dodgy, we go straight to the scanner.”* 

(Site H)
```
Those in mid-rate thrombolysis centres suggested that some of the delays in patient presentation could be mitigated through treatment by stroke physicians rather than generalists, or by the involvement of a Specialist Stroke Nurse: 

```{admonition} Quote
*“We typically have a more deprived population, so accessing health care and time to hospital [and] our ambulance service is not as good…”, “a burden of disease due to deprivation… we do see a lot of young strokes… smoking, drinking, drug abuse… expertise is important there, so if you looked at our patients… the ones that had been thrombolysed under 30 minutes… nearly all of them had been managed by a stroke registrar or a geriatrics registrar or a geriatrics consultant.”* (Site E)

*“[a] stroke nurses being there increases the speed…”(Site D)*
```
Those physicians currently working in centres with low or medium thrombolysis rates seemed more likely to emphasise the equipment that they lacked, and which they perceived would improve the accuracy and speed of their decision making. 

Similarly, physicians working in hospitals with higher thrombolysis rates suggested that their higher rates were due to access to scans and other specialist facilities, as well as 24 hour stroke services: 

```{admonition} Quote
*“We’re a big teaching hospital… that’s also got a trauma centre”* (Site H)

*“Thrombolysis is done by registrars with consultation on the phone with some access to the imaging for the consultant… there is no dedicated stroke team at night… we have a big variation between out of hours and in hours door to needle time… it’s 38 minutes, out of hours it’s 89 minutes… don’t thrombolyse wake up stroke… MRI… perfusion scan… we don’t have the facilities.”* (Site F)

*“On SSNAP data, we are one of the top performing units in the country and that has happened through years of planning and hard work, where we take direct admissions, twenty-four seven, we don’t do remote assessments… it’s always face to face assessments by consultant… with a specialist nurse, to see a patient, etc. And we have access to scans directly, including vascular imaging…”* (Site G)
```

Thus, the provision of more diagnostic tools was perceived as enabling a more nuanced approach to risk management - that went beyond tallying risk factors, and individualised patient care for more ‘marginal’ case:

```{admonition} Quote
*“If I might manage a level of uncertainty about the onset time and some other characteristics, medications, for example, a slightly imperfect history that I have, if it’s a very severe stroke, it’s going to be a disabling stroke and I feel that the risks are outweighed by the benefits... I think that stroke severity and my perception of the ability to benefit from thrombolysis will then weigh into how much uncertainty I’m able to cope with, with the other things.”* (Site G)
```

Although the sample interviewed was small, they were diverse in their attitudes to thrombolysis use.
