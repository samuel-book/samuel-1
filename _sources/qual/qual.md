# Qualitative research

## Objectives

The overall objective of the qualitative research was to understand influence of modelling, including the use of machine learning techniques, in the context of the national audit, in order to support efforts to maximise the appropriate use of thrombolysis and reduce unnecessary variation. 

Specifically the aims were to:

1. Explore current understanding and rationale for the use of thrombolysis for ischaemic stroke, in order to establish reasons for the variance in the use and speed of thrombolysis.

2. Understand physician perspectives on simulation and machine learning feedback, to influence how simulation can be incorporated into the Sentinel Stroke National Audi Programme (SSNAP) to have a positive impact on practice. 

3. Identify potential routes for the implementation of machine learning feedback, to inform and improve future stroke management.

4. Explore how physicians interpret the potential consequences of following changes in pathway suggested by simulation.

## Data collection

Ethical approval was provided by the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) 19/HRA/5796.

To pilot our interview approach, we undertook a face-to-face group interview with a small group of medical registrars on a regional rotation that included stroke, in their clinical setting. Having given written consent to interview, a senior modeller (MA) provided the registrars with a demonstration of the modelling process and outcomes, prior to the qualitative researchers piloting the topic guide. Feedback from the stroke physicians suggested that this approach was appropriate and produced data that was fit for purpose.
Our approach was subsequently modified for remote delivery, with all interviews conducted via MS Teams, Skype or Zoom, dependant on the media that was allowed in each NHS Trust. At the beginning of each interview participants watched a 10-minute video made by the senior modeller that contained examples of the process and outcomes of the machine modelling and pathway analysis, as a stimulus for discussion [1]. The topic guide was then used to elicit participants’ own experiences of thrombolysis and perspectives on machine learning, alongside observations of group interactions and clinical settings [2].

During the interviews, we collected data about physicians’ backgrounds, their attitudes to thrombolysis and their understanding of variance, their perspectives on machine learning, and potential loci for the implementation of machine learning feedback (within and beyond SSNAP), established the physicians’ views on possible unintended consequences, which may result from changing the acute stroke pathway, and potential means of mitigation. Our fieldnotes reflected the challenges of conducting interviews via video, with physicians often in clinical settings and sometimes wearing PPE, as well as capturing the dynamics between physicians, who were also remote working from each other [3, 4].

Towards the end of the project, and during the third lockdown for COVID-19, we undertook an online discussion of our results with a small group of physicians (N=3) who were identified via an annual meeting for trainees, organised by the British Association for Stroke Physicians (BASP). The modellers (MA, CJ) presented a further set of outputs from their analyses, and the discussion focused on how additional modelling outputs might be used to facilitate quality improvement and inform service delivery. 


## Current attitudes to thrombolysis use
Physicians working in hospitals with lower thrombolysis rates were more likely to suggest that a significant barrier to thrombolysis was the delayed presentation of patients, which could be magnified by suboptimal ambulance services:
