# Introduction to SAMueL-1

"Your decision to treat or not treat … That’s the difficult part. That’s the grey area where everyone does a different thing."

This Jupyter Book contains methods (code) and results for the SAMueL-1 project: *Use of simulation and machine learning to identify key levers for maximising the disability benefit of intravenous thrombolysis in acute stroke pathways.* NIHR HS&DR Reference Number: 17/99/89

## Overall aims

The overall aims of the project are

* Model thrombolysis decision-making using machine learning, so that we may ask the question 'what treatment would my patient receive at other hospitals?'

* Model the stroke pathway, using clinical pathway simulation, so that we may ask the question 'what would happen to a hospital's thrombolysis use of, and benefit from, thrombolysis by changing key aspects of the pathway including:

    * Pathway speed
    
    * Determining stroke onset times
    
    * Making decisions according to the majority vote of decisions that would be expected at a 'benchmark* set of hospitals
