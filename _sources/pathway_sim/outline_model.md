# Model building and validation

This section describes extraction of pathway parameters for each hospital, and validation of the model.


This section contains the following notebooks:

* *Extract hospital performance for pathway model*: Extract pathway performance for each hospital (including breakdown by weekday/weekend/day/night).

* *validation*: Test predicted thrombolysis use vs actual thrombolysis use for each hospital.
