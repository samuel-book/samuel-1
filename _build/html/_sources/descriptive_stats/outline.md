# Outline - what is in this section?

This section contains the following notebooks:

* *Descriptive analysis of stroke pathway data*: Describe mean patient and pathway characteristics, and describe variation across stroke teams, and variation between age groups (under age 80 vs. 80+).

* *Association between patient features on use of thrombolysis*: Examine relationship between patient features and use of thrombolysis. Analysis by Disability (modified Rankin Scale) before stroke; Stroke severity (NIHSS); Gender; Ethnicity; Age group; Onset known; Arrival by ambulance; Co-morbidities.

* *Comparison of average values for patients who receive thrombolysis and those that do not*: A comparison of feature means for patients who receive thrombolysis and those that do not.

* *Pathway patterns throughout the day*: Analysis of key pathway statistics broken down by time of day (3 hour epochs).

* *Pathway patterns throughout the week*: Analysis of key pathway statistics broken down by day of week.

* *Pathway patterns throughout the day in an example single stroke team*: Analysis of key pathway statistics broken down by time of day (3 hour epochs) in a single stroke team.

* *Pathway patterns throughout the week in an example single stroke team*: Analysis of key pathway statistics broken down by day of week in a single stroke team.

* *Stroke pathway timing distribution*: Visualise distributions for onset-to-arrival, arrival-to-scan, and scan-to-needle
